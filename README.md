Welcome to the world of image classification, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are harnessed to predict whether an image features a cat or a dog. This project delves into the power of deep learning, exploring model training and gaining insights from Jupyter Notebooks. Join us on this exciting journey as we uncover the potential of CNN in distinguishing between our furry friends.
